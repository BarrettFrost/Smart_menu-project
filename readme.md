Smart_Menu

////Preliminary Draft

Smart_Menu is a lightweight and simple Internet-of-Things interface that connects a restaurant menu database directly to user preferences. Combining the functions of a menu database service from food apps (e.g Yelp) and diet trackers (e.g. [insert app here]), Smart users are able to preemptively preview what dishes served in the restaurants fit their dietary profile, making dietary tracking more convenient.

An Overview

A simple summary of the Smart_Menu pipeline across the three platforms (desktop, web, m5 Stack) is as follows:

  a. Desktop: This is the restaurants' end. Restaurants register with the service and upload their menu to the web server.
  b. Web: This is the developer/service provider end. The web service registers restaurants(generates the unique restaurant ID) and stores the database to be accessed by users.
  c. m5 Stack: This is the users' end. Users set their dietary preferences on the app, which then provides assistance when navigating the restaurants registered on the service as they plan their order (e.g. by highlighting dishes that exceed their intended calorie intake or dietary restrictions).
