Smart_Menu

////Preliminary Draft

Smart_Menu is an Internet of Things (IoT) solution that matches your dietary needs directly with what's on the menu (in the restaurant)! Combining a menu browser (common in food finding apps, e.g Yelp) with a diet planner (e.g. [insert app here]), Smart_Menu makes planning your next meal safer and more convenient than ever before.

1. System Design [1000 words]:

(a. Architecture): *Insert flow diagram*

User story: The system will be used initiated by a customer using the IOT device to order a meal from a restaurant. Before doing so, They would have first set their dietary preferences: restrictions and desired calories per meal. The customer would query the Web Application for a list of restaurants from the company running the system. They would then select the restaurant they want to order food from and send that information to the company. Then the company would ask the restaurant owner for the menu. After the company would relay this menu to the customer which they would choose their meal and save their order.

(b. Object-Oriented design of key sub-systems)

All of our sub-systems were built around principles of object-oriented design. The reasons for this were obvious to us: we would be working predominantly with abstract data types, and handling multiple instances of the same objects, ('restaurants' and 'food'). Standardizing on OOP would also allow us to homogenize across all the subsystems, keeping things simple to understand and easy to debug.

Excepts from our m5 and Desktop application design, that were most driven my these principles, are as follows:

*M5*

The smart menu design featured the List and menu classes. Since the menu must be able to display, select and flag an unknown number of restaurant names or menu items, object-oriented design seemed to most appropriate approach.  The code had an array of list and menu once the items have been received via JSON. The classes allow variables associated with each menu item e.g. the name. These variables could then be manipulated, for instance selecting an item and using method to change the selection integer or changing the flag depending on Booleans for dietary requirements.

*DESKTOP Object oriented design*

This model is for a restaurent which could connect with web - sending its restaurant name, get its restaurant id and then send its menu items.

So there are at least three main object:

*Class* Restaurant - which contains (String) restaurant_name, (String) restaurant_id;

*Class* Food - which contains (String) food_name, (int) food_calories,  (boolean) if_vegetarian, (boolean) ifcontain_gluten,    (boolean) ifcontain_nuts;

class Menu - which contains an arraylist, Food[] foods.

These functions make the system of a restaurant_menu:

  - adding some new food [add_item(), doAdd() function]: pass name, calories,  vegetarian, gluten, nuts as parameters and create a new food object;
  - editing existing food [edit_item(), doUpdata() function]: just create a new food object like add_item, and then do some update, to send new items as json package;
  - deleting existing food [delete(), doDelete() function]: we use menu object, and delete the selected index;
  - doing registration [registration(), doRegister() function]: send menu item in the format of json Package.

Requirements for key sub-systems

An overview of the key requirements of our sub-systems (desktop, web, m5 Stack) were decided as follows:

  a. The Desktop Application represents the restaurants' end. It would need to be able to register with the service, and be able to upload/update their data, e.g. name and menu, on the database.

  b. The Web Application represents the developer/service provider end. It would need to handle restaurant registration and the service's database.

  c. The Arduino/m5 Stack represents the consumer end. It has two primary feature. The first is allowing users to configure their dietary preferences. Next is recording an order. the M5 accesses and browses restaurant menus saved on the web application. The user's configured preferences should be read as the order is made, e.g. by flagging dishes that exceed their intended calorie intake, or contain unsafe ingredients.

(d. The evolution of UI wireframes for key sub-systems)

*DESKTOP*
- EDITION 1.0: have 2 pages for desktop app
    - A restaurant menu page: show the items of menu, and for registration
    - A registration page: the users can input restaurant name and choose 'register' and 'cancel'
- EDITION 2.0: have 2 pages, which including a restaurant menu page, a registration page
    - A restaurant menu page: show the items of menu, and the user can select the specific items of this menu, which helps user to delete. Another function in this page is to register.
    - A registration page
- EDITION 3.0: have 3 pages, which including a restaurant menu page, a registration page and a add/edit page
    - A restaurant menu page: the user can select the specific items not only for deleting items, but also for edit items. Totally there are 4 functions in this page: ADD, EDIT, DELETE, REGISTER_NEW (means the regiatration for a new restaurant)
    - A add/edit page: the user could add the information of particular food item into the menu, which includs the name of food, food calories, and set if this food contains meat, nuts and gluten...the user could also edit those information in a page that has the memory of privious food information
    - A registration page

*M5*

Due to the limited buttons we had to divide access to pages between 3 separate branches as seen from the diagrams above. There is a consistent layout for all pages to make the user experience more intuitive. This layout consisted of a title at the top and below displayed whatever functions the page served. At the bottom there are buttons squares with names attached describing the certain function of the button, whether it be moving to another page or saving an order. The buttons on screen were designed to line up with the buttons on the physical device so that the user knew which button did what. For the flagging of menu items red circles was chosen to be used. The M5 stack provides several ways to do this but it needs to be non-obtrusive and striking. The red colour draws the userâ€™s attention and the small circle does not take up too much space.

*Web Application*

- Started with a basic html table displaying registered restaurant data.
- Basic Bootstrap implementation, e.g. responsive table, to improve user experience.
- Added menu browser.
- Further visual improvements through Bootstrap.

Communication protocols  

(e. Details of the communication protocols in use)

Our communication protocol is simple, relying on two variables, queryID and conID, stored in our JSON packet to distinguish packets. queryID is a two digit integer sequence that identifies the type of query. The first digit in the sequence denotes the query type, while the second digit, either '0' or '1', denotes when the packet is a query or a reply ('0' = query, '1' = reply). All used sequences are labelled below:

//10: M5 requesting restaurant list from web application. Reply: 11
//20: M5 requesting menu from selected restaurant. Reply: 21
//30: Desktop app (restaurant) registering with the web server. Reply: 31
//40: Desktop app (restaurant) updating information with the web server. Reply: 41

conID serves to identify unique conversations between devices. This ensure that replies are received and read properly.

(f. Details of the data persistence mechanisms in use)

*M5*

 The ardiuno-esp32 Preferences library allowed us to save the contents to flash memory on the M5 stack for permanent storage. This was necessary for the M5 stack to save the user dietary requirements, maximum calories per meal and the contents of the order they want to place. The preferences library had partitioning for the variables and each variable could be assessed using a key. The dietary requirements were saved as integers with 0(false) and 1(true). The max calories were saved as integer as well and the menu items and restaurant name were saved as a string.

*DESKTOP Data persistence*

 - We have the need of persist data about menu and single restaurant in the daily life.
 - We use json file (menu.json, restaurant.json) as API instead of real database.
 - In processing desktop, we use functions such as loadMenu() and loadReataurant() to load the json file, and to use this database.
 - When the user add/edit/delete the food, or register a new restaurant, the data would be changed in the saved json file!

2. System Implementation [1000 words]:
  a. Breakdown of project into sprints (showing the users stories implemented in each).

Ideation: Late Jan - Early Feb
The project first began with work on the M5. Once we settled on the general direction of our project (a combined menu browser + diet tracker) we started to outline what 'front-end' features such an interface would include. We initially envisioned a system that worked locally in the restaurant, where participating restaurants would encode the food date onto a unique identifier on each dish (conceptually, a QR code, or colored plate e.g. a sushi bar), to be scanned by restaurant patrons when ordering. This is captured by the captured footage of the paper prototype:

This idea was quickly scrapped and we moved to a fully online system. Among other reasons, we considered the burden of implementation for restaurants to be far too high. We also received feedback from test participants that the physical step was unintuitive, requiring extensive explanation to grasp.

V1 of the M5 application (Feb): Feb
We moved to write our paper prototype as a program on the M5.

Discussion of data Structure, Planning Web & Desktop application:
With a firm idea of the front end features, we began to discuss networking, and the web/desktop applications.

  c. Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of the work

3. Project Evaluation [800 words]:
  a. Reflective discussion of the success of the project
  b. Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
  c. Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).
  d. This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)

The project was a success, so far as achieving its intended goals. We successfully implemented all the primary intended features, most crucially in a manner that was conducive to future iteration and improvement.

Among considered directions for future work would be a persistent database for the web server. This would certainly be essential in a true final commercial product but was excluded in our project scope. This would likely be a sim. Another significant additional function would be a feedback/report system. There is currently no built in form of communication between the intended user groups. While it was excluded on the grounds that it's not a core feature, this functionality is important in any commercial ready product to collect userbase feedback and communicate sentiment/service disruptions. Finally, significant additional UI/UX work could be made to make the product more visually appealing.

The group worked well to accomplish its goal despite numerous challenges. Our design sprints demonstrate that we practiced AGILE design principles from the very start, steadily building up our product in layers and organizing 'functionality test' meetings regularly.

Evaluation M5

All the main functions of the M5 were successfully implemented and during the testing of the system the M5 performed as intended. Since the M5 was the system that had to initialise the networking. When buttons were pressed, they had to produce and send a JSON String to the server. Once the response is received then the M5 would move onto the next page. This response was very rapid during testing worked without flaw. Though an issue may arise if the M5 does not receive a response back from the MQTT as the M5 does not notify the user when this has occurred. Whereas during the initial setup of the M5 there is message displaying connecting which will notify the user when M5 cannot connect to the WI-FI. One of the M5 issues was it is not suited to be a menu due to the size of the screen. We had to use the smallest text size to fit as much menu items in the screen as possible. But this may cause difficulty in reading for some users and there had to be a limit on the number of menu items. Another UI issue was the cursor had to be made from a line which once again might be difficult to see.  Though overall the UI for the M5 is intuitive for the user due to the consistent layout (write about the layout in UI wireframe). The saving to permanent memory was successful for dietary requirement and max calories, for the menu it would have been better to save the menu as an array instead of multiple strings. For the structure of the code a switch was used to access each page, each of these had functions to display the UI. Some pages had reused functions such as draw_buttons() and line_cursor(). Of course each page had separate functions for specific tasks such JSON_publish_menu(), save_order() and set_cal().  So overall the code structure makes the system very maintainable for future updates.

Future work

The most obvious feature to improve for the M5 would be increase the maximum menu items. Both saving menu as an array and implanting a scroll feature on listing pages would rectify this. The scroll feature could implement using the built-in gyroscopes on the M5. Another useful feature to implement would be to display the dietary requirements and max calories that have set in all pages so that user does not have to enter the preference branch to find out. Better error handling when the M5 has not received a JSON String. All pages have a use for each button except for my order page were only 2 buttons were used, it would have good to implement another feature. Obviously, this is a prototype in a commercial product with a touch screen interface it would be possible to have less of branch layout and some pages could be combined. Also, the menu could be incorporated into a better design like being incorporated into a table in a restaurant.  

Ethics

One aspect that is worth consideration in the M5 is saving personal information about the userâ€™s health. Though this is not an issue for
the M5 as the data is only stored locally and no personal information is sent over any network.
