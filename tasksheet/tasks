Section 2: Task Breakdown

----M5----
[M5][CORE]Main menu
 - Difficulty: Easy
 -	[Basic]Create a page to navigate a list with two choices called ‘Preferences’ and ‘New Meal’. Selecting 'Preferences' should execute a function called navPref() that loads the dietary preferences page; Selecting 'New Meal' should execute a function called navMeal() that loads the New Meal page
 -	[Extend]Extend the list and interactions to include two more options: ‘Recent Activity’ and ‘Help’. The pages’ navigation functions are, respectively, navRecent() and navHelp().

[M5][CORE]A page to save/set dietary preferences
 - Difficulty: Hard
 -	[Basic]Write a page that shows at list of the following editable options: ‘Kcal per meal’, ‘Vegetarian’, ‘Gluten-free’, ‘Nuts’.
  *‘Kcal per meal’ is an integer value. 
  *‘Vegetarian’, ‘Gluten-free’, ‘Nuts’ are Booleans (true/false)
 -	[Extend]Add the ability to save the user’s preferences. When clicked, it saves the user’s preferences to an external file. This file should also now be loaded and displayed by default when a user accesses the page.

[M5][CORE]A page to select menu items
 - Difficulty: Hard
 -	[Basic] Create a navigatable and selectible menu{} object that is infact a list/array of objects called food{}. Each food{} object contains the following elements: 
  *Name(string); 
  *Calories (int); 
  *Vegetarian(bool); 
  *Gluten-free(bool); 
  *Nuts(bool). 
 -	[Extend]Implement loading dietary preferences. During initialization, the page should load the file containing the user's preferences. These preferences will be used to determine what food{} items are not suitable for the user to consume. You have freedom to decide how to most clearly/effectively highlight incompatible menu items. An easy example might be highlighting invalid items in red.
 - [Extend]Implement the saveOrder() function. saveOrder() should write the user's order to an external savefile, to be accessed by other functionalities in the program. First, each food{} item selected should be copied to a new array called order{}. When saved, the order{} should be sent to the saveOrder() function, which writes the external file. 

[M5][EXT]A page for loading
[M5][EXT]A page to navigate a list of restaurants
[M5][EXT]Build a page to navigate recent orders
[M5][EXT]A page to display meal deals
[M5][EXT]Help section

----WEBSITE----
[WEB][CORE] A page that displays a table of restaurants
[WEB][CORE] A page that adds/deletes restaurants from the table
[WEB][EXT] A page to generate/return a random 6-digit alphanumeric id
[WEB][EXT] A page to process/approve new restaurants

----DESKTOP----
[DESKTOP][CORE] A restaurant menu page
 - Difficulty: Hard
 -	[Basic]Create a navigatable menu{} object that is infact a list/array of objects called food{}. This list/array should be displayed as a table on the page. Each food{} object contains the following elements: 
  *Name(string); 
  *Calories (int); 
  *Vegetarian(bool); 
  *Gluten-free(bool); 
  *Nuts(bool).  
 - [Extend]Implement a saveMenu() function where the menu is saved to an external file. The page should now also load a saved menu{} file when initializing (if available), rather than starting with a blank menu table every time.
 
[DESKTOP][CORE] A page to edit/add the restaurant menu
 - Difficulty: Easy
 - [Basic]Create a page to edit the menu{} object on the website. There should be at least two basic functions: adding new food{} and editing existing food{}. 
 
[DESKTOP][EXT] A page to register as a new user on the website
