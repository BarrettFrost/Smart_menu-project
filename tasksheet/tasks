Section 2: Task Breakdown
[CORE]Main menu
1.	Build a homepage for the m5 stack. 
•	[Basic]Write a page that shows at list of at least two interactable options: ‘Preferences’ and ‘New Meal’. Each option, when selected, will navigate to a new page on the m5 program using the following functions: navNewMeal() and navRecent().
•	[Extend]Extend the list and interactions to include two more options: ‘Recent Activity’ and ‘Help’. The pages’ navigation functions, respectively, are navPref() and navHelp().
2.	Difficulty: Easy
[CORE]A page to save/set dietary preferences
3.	Build a page on the m5 stack to save and edit the user’s dietary preferences. 
•	[Basic]Write a page that shows at list of the following editable options: ‘Kcal per meal’, ‘Vegetarian’, ‘Gluten-free’, ‘Nuts’.
i.	‘Kcal per meal’ is an integer value. 
ii.	‘Vegetarian’, ‘Gluten-free’, ‘Nuts’ are Booleans (true/false)
•	[Extend]Add the ability to save the user’s preferences. When clicked, it saves the user’s preferences to an external file. This file should also now be loaded and displayed by default when a user accesses the page.
4.	Difficulty: Hard
[CORE]A page to select menu items
5.	Build a page that navigates and selects from a list of menu items. 
•	[Basic] Create a menu{} object that is infact a list/array of objects called food{}. Each food{} object contains the following elements: Name(string); Calories (int); Vegetarian(bool); Gluten-free(bool); Nuts(bool). 
•	Extend:
i.	Extend the list and interactions to include two more options: ‘Recent Activity’ and ‘Help’. The pages’ navigation functions, respectively, are navPref() and navHelp().
